            <h2>Am I a first-generation college student?</h2>
            <p>At the University of Michigan, undergraduates and graduate students are considered first-generation college students if neither parent or guardian has completed a 4-year college or university degree.
                <br>
                This definition includes students with other family members (siblings, cousins, grandparents, etc.) who have completed a four-year degree.
